# 1. Load R data table  
# 2. Make patches 
#    - Assign patch age, area, and land use type
# 3. Make cohorts
#    - Assign cohorts to patches
#    - Assign PFTs to species
#    - Remove dead trees
#    - Combine individuals into cohorts

### SUBSET DATA - to speed up FATES runs we are only going to read in a single ha of data. 
### If your dataset is very large (>10 ha) consider doing this too during the tutorial.  
### For full simulations you should use the full dataset. 

### To get a single quadrat we select all stems with x and y coordinates less than 100 m
